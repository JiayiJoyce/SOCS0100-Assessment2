1. two scrapped data sets 
## Getting started

### 1. Set up

In each document, the set up code (which installs packages and sets the environment) are all located under the `#setup` section at the beginning. Remove the `#` in front of them to download & activate the necessary packages.

## Contribution

The tophits data were automatically collected using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) package

The IFPI annual data were statically scrapped from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_recorded_music_markets)

I consulted the following tutorials to explore the functions of Spotify API

1.  [Exploring the Spotify API with R](https://msmith7161.github.io/what-is-speechiness/)
2.  [Using the spotify API in R](https://youtu.be/utWH3c8a3dA?si=lOha5QRRoZL4nN8u)

For the plots, I consulted the following tutorials
1. [scatter plot of market size]{https://youtu.be/SnCi0s0e4Io?si=t17n-ViTAuvjNmRv}
2. [radar chart of the popular audio features in different country](https://r-graph-gallery.com/143-spider-chart-with-saveral-individuals.html)
